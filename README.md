# Assessing Brain Age with Computer Vision

This project uses transfer learning to train a ResNet18 model to identify the age of a brain from its MRI scan. This kind of identification could potentially be used to flag various congnitive disorders such as Alzhiemers Disease if the "brain age" is identified as more advanced than the patient's chronological age.

(problem and relevant previous efforts)

## Data

We used 1267 congnitively normal files from the ADNI MRI dataset. These were black and white 3D images, stored in 3D numpy arrays that had already been cleaned and pre-processed. 

## Modeling

(selection, evaluation)

## Conclusions

## Demo:

Please open main.ipynb in Google Colab to interact with the model.
